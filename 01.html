      The mining team couldn't believe how much time we were able to 
      save with this tool we had developed in-house. We like to use it.
      I loved building it.

        For this project I was able to find a way to make a process more efficient.
        Normally it took us about three to four hours to run the simulations for a 
        month of production. With the tool developed in Excel, we were able to have it
        in less than an hour.

        This optimizer included the constraints, the materials to be fed. It helped
        us to consider many variables to focus on feeding what helps to optimize
        production.
