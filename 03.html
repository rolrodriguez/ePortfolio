      <p>
        We used to make our reports manually. We had to repeat ourselves so much. It was dangerous
        to continue like this as we could become complacent with this and make mistakes.
        As part of a team I was able to reduce the time for the reports' updates and increase 
        consistency.

        Our macros updated the reports by pressing one button. We would save the official figures 
        into our process historian afterwards to keep track of what we have achieved so far.
