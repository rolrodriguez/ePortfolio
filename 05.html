        This was a project for our Software Development class. During the class we learned
        how to program in Java and we were introduced to Android Development. As part of our
        final project, we had to develop an app. Ours was focused on the young single adults of
        the church. The purpose of the app was to help them date, by providing suggestions on
        what to do.

        We had many complications as part of the development. But we made it work with most of
        what we originally intended.
